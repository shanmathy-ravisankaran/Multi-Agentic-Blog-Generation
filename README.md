## About The Project

BlogBoard is an end-to-end, fully automated blogging platform. It autonomously schedules, writes, formats, and publishes deep-dive technical articles on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence directly to a fast, static frontend website.

Powered by **LangGraph** for stateful workflow execution and **Groq** for blazing-fast LLM inference, it ensures that high-quality, zero-fluff, production-grade articles are generated and deployed automatically via **GitHub Actions**.

## Library Requirements

 - Python 3.12+
 - langgraph>=0.2.20
 - groq>=0.11.0
 - python-dotenv>=1.0.1
 - uv (for dependency management)

## Getting Started

This will help you understand how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Installation Steps

### Installation from GitHub

Follow these steps to install and set up the project directly from the GitHub repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to install the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/shanmathy-ravisankaran/Multi-Agentic-Blog-Generation.git
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
     ```bash
     uv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
       ```bash
       # On Linux/Mac:
       source .venv/bin/activate
       # On Windows:
       .venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd BlogBoard-AI-Blog-Generator
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```bash
     uv pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**
   - Start the backend pipeline by running the appropriate command:
     ```bash
     python backend/run.py
     ```

6. **Access the Project**
   - Serve the frontend locally using Python's built-in HTTP server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000 --directory frontend
     ```
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
